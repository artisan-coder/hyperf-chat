# Installation using Composer

The easiest way to create a new Hyperf project is to use Composer. If you don't have it already installed, then please install as per the documentation.

To create your new Hyperf project:

$ git clone git@github.com:artisan-coder/hyperf-chat.git
$ composer install -vvv

Once installed, you can run the server immediately using the command below.


$ php bin/hyperf.php start

This will start the cli-server on port `9501`, and bind it to all network interfaces. You can then visit the site at `http://localhost:9501/`

which will bring up Hyperf default home page.
